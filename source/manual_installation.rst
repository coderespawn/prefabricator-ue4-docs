Manual Plugin Installation
==========================

If for some reason you don't want to use the Marketplace version, you can grab the latest release from the github `Releases <https://github.com/coderespawn/prefabricator-ue4/releases>`_ page and install it manually in your game project

First, uninstall the marketplace version from the Launcher, then follow these steps

* Navigate to your game project directory
* Create a directory named Plugins
* Extract the downloaded release archive and navigate to the appropriate engine version (e.g. 4.24)
* Copy the Prefabricator folder over to the Game projects Plugins folder so that we have ``GAME_PROJECT/Plugins/Prefabricator``
