## Nested Prefabs

A prefab can be created by combining other smaller prefabs.   These are called nested prefabs

We'll use the barrel prefab from our previous example. Drop in 3 barrel prefabs on to the scene.   

{% include inline_image.html file="nested_prefabs/nested_prefab_01.jpg" %}

Hold down the **Control** key and select the three prefabs. We will be using this selection to create a new prefab

{% include note.html content="Make sure you see a green outline around the selection. Green outline means prefab selection" %}
