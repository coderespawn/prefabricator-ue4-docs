## Create Prefab

Start by selecting the actors in the scene that you'd like to create a prefab with

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_select_actors.jpg" alt="Select the actors" %}


From the toolbar, click the Prefabricator drop down menu and choose **Create Prefab** to create a prefab with 
the currently selected actors in the scene

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_create_prefab_menu.png" alt="Create prefab menu" %}


This will create a prefab asset in the content browser's currently selected directory

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_prefab_content_browser.png" alt="Prefab Asset" %}


Notice the previously selected actors have now been converted to a prefab.  Prefabs have a green outline on them when selected in the editor

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_prefab_created.jpg" alt="Prefab created" %}

## Use Prefabs

Now that you have created a prefab asset, you can reuse this all across your maps

Drop your newly created prefab on to the scene

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_drop_prefab.jpg" alt="Prefab created" %}


Create a few more of these instances

{% include inline_image.html file="getting_started/A_drop_prefab_more.jpg" alt="Prefab created" %}


Congratulation! You've created and used your first prefab.  Explore the [Next Section][prefab_selection]
