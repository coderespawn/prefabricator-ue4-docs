## Prefab Selection

Select an existing prefab actor on the scene by clicking on it and move it around as a single unit.  A selected prefab would have a green outline to it

{% include note.html content="The green outlines will not show up if the editor is in *Game Mode*.  Press the **G key** in the editor viewport to toggle it" %}

{% include inline_image.html file="selection/B_selection.jpg" alt="Selected Prefab" %}

## Prefab Item Selection

Click on the prefab again to select the item inside the prefab

{% include inline_image.html file="selection/B_selection_item.jpg" alt="Selected Prefab" %}

Clicking on the prefab toggles between the prefab and the items inside it. This is useful when you want to modify the contents of a prefab (if you are using nested prefabs, 
the selection would cycle between the different prefab levels)


You can also select the items inside the prefab from the World Outliner
